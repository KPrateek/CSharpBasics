# Introduction

In C#, events are a fundamental mechanism for implementing the observer pattern, enabling loosely coupled communication between objects. They allow one part of an application (the publisher) to notify other parts (subscribers) when something of interest occurs, without the publisher needing to know the specifics of who is listening.

# Core concepts
---
---

- **Publisher**: The class or object that raises or triggers the event. 
- **Subscriber**: The class or object that listens for and responds to the event. 
- **Event**: A notification that something has happened. 
- **Delegate**: A type that represents a method signature. Events are built upon delegates, acting as a type-safe mechanism for event handling. 

# Working Process
---
---
- A publisher defines an event (often using the event keyword) and associates it with a delegate. 
- Subscribers register (or subscribe) to the event, providing methods (event handlers) that will be executed when the event is raised. 
- When the publisher wants to notify subscribers, it raises the event. 
- The event mechanism then invokes all registered event handlers. 

# Key Benefits

---

- Loose Coupling:
- Publishers and subscribers don't need to know each other's implementation details, making code more modular and maintainable.
- Flexibility: Events allow for dynamic addition or removal of subscribers without modifying the publisher.
- Extensibility: New subscribers can be added easily, extending the functionality of the application.
- Observer Pattern: Events are the core of the observer pattern, enabling objects to react to changes in other objects.
